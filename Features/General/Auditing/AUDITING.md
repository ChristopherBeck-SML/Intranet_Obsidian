			- Doesn't really give the detail needed
			- Specific to each database
		- Separate Audit Database
			- Centralised location for all database change logs
			- Master database containing tables for each tracked database
				- AuditID (AutoNumber, Primary Key): A unique identifier for each audit record.
				- TableName (Text): The name of the table in the tracked database that was modified.
				- FieldName (Text): The name of the field/column that was changed.

				- NewValue (Text): The new value of the field after the change.
				- ChangeTimestamp (Date/Time): The date and time when the change occurred.
				- UserName (Text): The name of the user who made the change.
			- Link tracked DB to audit DB
				- External Data -> Import & Link 
			- Create macros to capture change and add record to audit DB
