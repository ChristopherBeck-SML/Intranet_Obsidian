The choice between a bespoke toolbar for each page or a unified toolbar based on access levels depends on several factors, including user experience, efficiency, and the complexity of your system. Here are some considerations for each approach:

1. Bespoke Toolbar for Each Page:
    
    - Pros:
        - Provides context-specific options: Users accessing a particular page can see relevant actions immediately, reducing cognitive load and making it easier to find the necessary functions.
        - Tailored user experience: Different roles may have unique requirements and workflows, so a customized toolbar for each page can enhance usability for specific user groups.
    - Cons:
        - Navigation consistency: Users may need to familiarize themselves with different toolbars on each page, potentially leading to a learning curve or confusion if the layouts vary significantly.
        - Maintenance: Updating or adding new features to multiple toolbars can be time-consuming and require more effort, especially if there are many pages with specific functionalities.
2. Unified Toolbar Based on Access Levels:
    
    - Pros:
        - Consistent navigation: A unified toolbar provides a consistent user experience across the intranet, allowing users to quickly locate common actions regardless of the page they are on.
        - Efficiency and familiarity: Users can easily switch between pages and perform common actions without needing to adapt to different toolbar layouts.
        - Easier maintenance: Making changes to the toolbar can be more streamlined since updates are applied universally across the intranet.
    - Cons:
        - Potential clutter: Users may see options that are not relevant to their specific role or current page, which could create visual noise and reduce efficiency if they need to scan through irrelevant options.
        - Limited customization: Certain roles may have unique needs that cannot be accommodated with a one-size-fits-all approach, potentially leading to compromises in functionality.
