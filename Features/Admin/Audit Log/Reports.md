### Summary
Reports need to be able to be created to show access logs - these reports need to be versatile, including a way to set the parameters of the report (e.g. all database changes in the last 7 days, intranet access logs for a specific user) There should also be the ability to generate a quick summary report which is immediately opened in a new tab, or generate a more granular extended report which is either downloaded or emailed to the user.
